# STM32F0 Development Environment
Do you find stm32cubeide to be a pain in the ass?

Do you like having a lean, clean fighting machine of a development environment?

If you are looking to start developing for an STM32 for linux, then this repo is for you! 
After getting sick of the opacity of stm32cube and other IDEs, I decided to set up a minimalist build environment with all the tools I need.

This repo is designed to build for an STM32F0 (specifically an STM32F091RC-Nucleo board, but with some configuration in the project makefile, you can switch it to the type of your preference
Make sure you have st-flash installed if you want to actually put the code on your board.
